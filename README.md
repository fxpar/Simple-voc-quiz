you want to learn a set of 7 words at a time? no problem, just type 7 in the box for the number of questions

## change the columns of the question and expected answer

## Go to next set when it is memorized
You can tell the quiz to go to the next set of questions after a certain number of rounds. 
By default, it goes to the next level after three stars ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

You can easily add your own language at the bottom of the script.
